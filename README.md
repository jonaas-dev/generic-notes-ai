Vision models:

- The OpenAI Microscope is a collection of visualizations of every significant layer and neuron of 13important vision models <https://microscope.openai.com/models>.

#### Large language model (LLM)

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model>

A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabeled text using self-supervised learning or semi-supervised learning.

##### Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)

:memo: Articles:

- [Language Is Not All You Need: Aligning Perception with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14045.pdf)
- [Towards artificial general intelligence via a multimodal foundation model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30761-2)

#### Learning techniques

- Stochastic gradient descent, published in 1967
- Backpropagation

### Other feedforward networks

#### Directed acyclic graph (DAG)

#### Convolutional neural network (CNN)

CNN in your browser:

- <https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/>

#### Deep reinforcement learning

Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) is a subfield of machine learning that combines reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning. RL considers the problem of a computational agent learning to make decisions by trial and error

##### :rocket: Aplications
